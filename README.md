## Installation

```shell
brew install --cask textdown
```

The precompiled app is not notarized or signed, so the first time you run the app the system may show a warning about the impossibility to check for malicious software.

To fix, you can launch the app with right click (or ctrl click) on the app icon and choose the open action.

You can also execute this command from the terminal:

```sh
$ xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/TextDown.app # Default path; change if necessary
```

Alternatively, after trying to launch the app for the first time, you can open the System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General (tab) and click the Open Anyway button.

This will resolve the error of an unsigned application when launching the app.

## Markdown processing

For maximum compatibility with the Markdown format, the [`cmark-gfm`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) library is used. The library is a GitHub fork of the standard cmark tool to [process the Markdown files](https://github.github.com/gfm/). 

Compared to the `cmark-gfm`, these extensions have been added:
- [`Emoji`](#emoji): translate the emoji shortcodes like `:smile:` to :smile:.
- [`Heads anchors`](#heads-anchors): create anchors for the heads.
- `Highlight`: highlight the text contained between the markers `==`.
- [`Inline local images`](#inline-local-images): embed the image files inside the formatted output (required for the Quick Look preview).
- `Subscript`: subscript text between the markers `~`.
- `Superscript`: superscript text between the markers `^`.
- [`Math`](#mathematical-expressions): format the mathematical expressions.
- [`Syntax highlighting`](#syntax-highlighting): highlight the code inside fenced block.
- [`YAML header`](#yaml-header): render the yaml header at the begin of `rmd` or `qmd` files.


## Difference with the GitHub Markdown engine

Although GitHub has customized the [`cmark-gfm`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) library, it does not use it directly in the rendering process of Markdown files (see [this repository](https://github.com/github/markup)).
GitHub uses a number of libraries in Ruby for parsing and formatting source code that cannot easily be converted into a compiled library.

The main difference between this application and GitHub is the formatting of the source code.
Syntax highlighting uses a different library, so the formatting, colors scheme, and language token recognition are potentially different.

This application, when set to use the accurate engine for the language detection (used only when the language is not specified) uses a library derived from the [`Linguistic`](https://github.com/github/linguist#syntax-highlighting) framework adopted by GitHub.


## Settings

Open Preferences (⌘,) to configure rendering options, enable extensions, and customize the appearance of your Markdown documents.

The settings window uses a modern SwiftUI interface with four tabs:
- **General**: CSS themes, appearance, link behavior
- **Extensions**: Enable/disable Markdown extensions (emoji, math, tables, etc.)
- **Syntax**: Syntax highlighting configuration and themes
- **Advanced**: Parser options and reset to defaults

Changes take effect immediately in the preview pane. Click **Apply** to save settings permanently. 


### Themes

You can choose a CSS theme to render the Markdown file. The application is provided with a predefined theme derived from the GitHub style valid both for light and dark appearance. 

You can also use a style to extend the standard theme or to override it. 
User customized style sheet must have the settings for both light and dark appearance using the CSS media query:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { 
    /* … */ 
}
``` 

The custom style is appended after the CSS used for the highlight the source code. In this way you can customize also the style of the syntax highlight. 

[Syntax highlighting extension](#syntax-highlighting) allow to customize the appearance of the code blocks.

The theme popup menu has some extra commands available pressing the `alt` key.


### Options

You can also choose whether to open external links in the preview pane or in the default browser.


#### Emoji

You can enable the Emoji extension to handle the shortcodes defined by [GitHub](https://api.github.com/emojis). You can render the emoji with an emoticon glyph or using the image provided by GitHub (internet connection required). 

Multibyte emoji are supported, so `:it:` equivalent to the code `\u1f1ee\u1f1f9` must be rendered as the Italian flag :it:. 

Some emoji do not have an equivalent glyph on the standard font and will be replaced always with the relative image.

A list of GitHub emoji shortcodes is available [here](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md#people--body).

 
#### Inline local images

You can enable the Inline image extension to embed local images directly into the rendered HTML by converting them to Base64 data URLs.

Supported image references:
- Relative paths: `./image.jpg`, `image.jpg`, `assets/image.jpg`
- Absolute paths with `file://` schema: `file:///Users/username/Documents/image.jpg`

For `file://` URLs, you must provide the full absolute path. For images in the same folder as the Markdown file, use relative paths (the `./` prefix is optional).

The extension processes both Markdown image syntax (`![alt](path)`) and HTML `<img>` tags (when raw HTML is enabled).


#### Mathematical expressions

This extension allow to format the mathematical expressions using the LaTeX syntax like [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions).
Math rendering capability uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) display engine.

Inline math expressions are delimited with a dollar symbol `$`. Block expressions are delimited with a double dollar symbols `$$`.

Alternatively, you can use the ` ```math ` code block syntax to display a math expression as a block.

The [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) library is loaded from cdn.jsdelivr.net. The library is loaded if the markdown code contains ` ```math ` code blocks or one or more dollar sign.


#### Syntax Highlighting

This extension highlights the source code inside a fenced box.

The rendering engine is based on the [Highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php) library embedded in the app.

![syntax highlighting settings](./assets/img/syntax_interface.png)

You can customize the settings:

- Line numbers visibility.
- Word wrap options.
- Tabs replacements.
- Guess engine for undefined languages.

When the code block does not specify the language, it is possible to activate a guessing function. Two engines are available:

- Simple guess: it is based on the `magic` library;
- Accurate guess: it is based on the [`Enry`](https://github.com/go-enry/go-enry) library, that is a Golang porting of the Ruby [`linguist`](https://github.com/github/linguist/) library used by GitHub.

If no language is defined and the guessing fail (or is not enabled), the code is rendered as normal text.


### YAML header

You can enable the extension to handle a `yaml` header at the beginning of a file. You can choose to enable the extensions to all `.md` files or only for `.rmd` and `.qmd` files.

The header is recognized only if the file start with `---`. The yaml block must be closed with `---` or with `...`.

When the `table` extension is enabled, the header is rendered as a table, otherwise as a block of code. Nested tables are supported. 


## Build from source

When you clone this repository, remember to fetch also the submodule with `git submodule update --init`.

Some libraries (`Sparkle`, `Yams` and `SwiftSoup`) are handled by the Swift Package Manager. In case of problems it might be useful to reset the cache with the command from the menu `File/Packages/Reset Package Caches`.


### Dependency

The app uses the following libraries built directly from Xcode:
- [`highlight`](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php) for syntax highlighting.
- [`magic`](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/), used to guess the source code language when the guess mode is set to _simple_.
- [`Enry`](https://github.com/go-enry/go-enry), used to guess the source code language when the guess mode is set to _accurate_.
- [`PCRE2`](https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre2) and [`JPCRE2`](https://github.com/jpcre2/jpcre2) used by the heads extension.


`libpcre` require the `autoconf` utility to be build. You can install it with [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install autoconf
``` 

Because `Enry` is developed in `go`, to build the wrapper library you must have the `go` compiler installed (you can use `brew install go`). 

The compilation of `cmark-gfm` require `cmake` (`brew install cmake`).


## Note about the developer

I am not primarily an application developer. There may be possible bugs in the code, be patient.
Also, I am not a native English speaker :sweat_smile:. 

**This application was developed for pleasure :heart:.**
